 When I was 17 years old, I started a business with my Dad. We would go to carboot sales and buy secondhand vinyl records and resell them for a profit.
 We were making a little bit of money from it, so i had an idea; I would make a website for it. <br><br>
 Now, I had zero knowledge of web development or how the internet worked so, intuitively, I thought, how hard can it be. I made a terrrible looking website for it, poor design, the colours had no contrast, but the major issue was: it just didn't work. <br>
After taking a long hiatus and thinking it wasn't for me, web development became a huge interest for me, some 6 years later and I have been learning core concepts ever since. That website was called Brotherhood Records and I decided I would put together much of what I have learned so far into remaking it into a project taht actually works. So, here it is...Brotherhood Records v2.0
